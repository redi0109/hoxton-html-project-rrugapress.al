<p>The 2022 UEFA Nations League continues this week and will see Albania host Israel at the Air Albania Stadium on Friday.</p>
<p>Albania played out a 1-1 draw against Iceland in their opening game earlier this week. Taulant Seferi gave the Eagles the lead in the first half with his first-ever goal for the nation before their opponents drew level minutes after the restart following an error from Atalanta defender Berat Djimsiti.</p>
<p>The home side picked up one point in their first game but can go top of the group with a win this Friday.</p>
<p>Israel also had to settle for a point against Iceland in their first game, playing out a 2-2 draw against the Strákarnir okkar last week. The Blue and Whites went ahead via a Liel Abada strike but they soon found themselves behind after the restart before Real Valladolid's Shon Weissman came off the bench to rescue a point for his country.</p>
<h2>Albania vs Israel Head-to-Head</h2>
